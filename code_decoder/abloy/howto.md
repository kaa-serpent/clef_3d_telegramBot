# Abloy decoding - January 2024

## Overview
This project, made by Clefmentine in January 2024, involves visually decoding a key and requesting the factory to create a new one by providing the correct number for the property card.

## How it Works
1. **Determine Key Model:**
   - Identify the key model among the following options:
     - protect
     - protect2
     - dislock
     - dislock Pro
     - more abloy in general
2. **Decode the key:**
    - Protect / protect 2

    - Dislock / Dislock

    - Other not yet documented
## Usage
I am not responsible for bad usage of this code, I shared it to prove a security flow in Abloy key copy system
